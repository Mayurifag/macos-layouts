# My MacOS Layouts setup

## Description

This repository contains my MacOS Layouts ANSI setup. It is mostly Ilya Birman's
work, with some modifications:

* I've changed tilda key to be \` instead of \\ by default.
* Changed keyboard layout flags to be russian/us instead of default things.

## Installation

Move `*.icns` and `*.keylayout` files to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`.
Install them in Settings (check `Other` section)

To remove english layout, add Romaji/Kaja layouts, remove default English
layout and after that remove Romaji/Kaja layouts.

## Suggestions

* Should I move it to dotfiles repository?
* Do I need any other additional tweaks in layouts?

## Credits

* Ilya Birman's [Typography layouts](https://ilyabirman.ru/projects/typography-layout/)
